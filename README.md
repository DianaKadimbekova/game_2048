# 2048 GAME

## About the Game
**2048** is a classic single-player puzzle game where players combine numbered tiles on a 4×4 grid to create higher-value tiles. The objective is to strategically slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right) so that matching numbers merge when they collide. The game ends when the grid fills up with no possible moves left, with the ultimate goal of forming the 2048 tile—though skilled players can continue beyond it.
